#  Parallel Multi-Objective Shortest Path Updater (PMOSPU)

This project implements a parallel algorithm to update multi-objective shortest paths in large dynamic graphs, based on the research paper:  
**"A Parallel Algorithm for Updating a Multi-objective Shortest Path in Large Dynamic Networks" (Khanda et al.)**

---

##  Objective

To design and implement a scalable, parallel solution using MPI, OpenMP, and METIS that efficiently updates shortest paths in dynamic graphs without recomputing them from scratch.

## Technologies & Tools

- **MPI** â€“ For distributed inter-node parallelism  
- **OpenMP** â€“ For shared-memory (intra-node) parallelism  
- **METIS** â€“ For efficient graph partitioning  
- **C++** â€“ Language for implementation  
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control and progress tracking  
- **MPI Performance Analyzer** â€“ For performance evaluation

## Key Concepts from the Research

- Incremental shortest path updates using parallel processing  
- Reduces redundant computations by localizing updates  
- Uses multi-threaded processing within and across graph partitions  
- Efficient message passing between partitions for synchronization
